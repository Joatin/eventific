  <h3 class="mt-5">The problem</h3>
  <p>We have now concluded that Eventific is using CQRS and what that pattern is. However one big question remains, how do we maintain a state between a distributed system? In Redux we could just keep an object that tracts the current state in memory. But now we have 1-n services that needs to share the state. And since it is distributed how do we handle concurrency issues?</p>
</div>

  <h3 class="mt-5">Event Sourcing to the rescue</h3>
  <p>Event sourcing is a persistence pattern that resolves around saving the events that causes the state change rather than the state itself. Using these events we can later build up the current state. This is usually a rather quick process. The events are viewed as the single source of truth</p>
  <p>This pattern suits us like the hand in the glove. When we recieve a command we can simply validate the command and the turn it into one or several events that we the persist in something called the event store</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3 class="mt-5">Event Store</h3>
  <p>The event store is the place where we then persist the events after they have been created. This store can be used by a Saga, or by the Query side. Common stores could be MongoDB, DynamoDB, or MariaDB. However it could even be something as simple as a shared file.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3 class="mt-5">What about concurrency</h3>
  <p>The events in the event store does always have a sequential event id. So the first event has id 0, the second has id 1, the third has id 2, and so on... Lets say now that two command sides are trying to handle the same command at the same time. Both have now calculated that they want to insert a new command with id 3. The first of them will succeed on inserting that event, the second handler however will validate the unique constraint on the event id therefor fail to insert the command. What the command handler can do in that case is retry, and use the command to generate new event, or if the state has changed in such a way that the command can no longer be applied we can simply fail the command</p>
